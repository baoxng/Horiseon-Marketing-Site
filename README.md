# Horiseon-Marketing-Site

## Description of Project

This is a project to meet the needs of Horiseon Marketing Agency's website. In order to improve the back-end website, I had to refract a pre-exisiting code to make the codes more accessible and sustainable. The process of refractoring the code is to make the codes more organized without changing the functionality of the codes and website. 

The refractoring process for the website was challenging as this was a project that had much trial and error involved. I learned that an unorganized structure made it really hard to debug and troubleshoot functions that were not working properly. However, implementing semantic element for webpage layout was really helpful, because it kept the codes clean and organized. Check out my process of how I refracted existing codes for Horiseon website down below:
