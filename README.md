# Horiseon-Marketing-Site

## Description of Project

This is a project to meet the needs of Horiseon Marketing Agency's website. In order to improve the back-end website, I had to refract a pre-exisiting code to make the codes more accessible and sustainable. The process of refractoring the code is to make the codes more organized without changing the functionality of the codes and website. 

The refractoring process for the website was challenging as this was a project that had much trial and error involved. I referenced to google, W3schools, and YouTube to help me understand concepts and functions. I learned that an unorganized structure made it really hard to debug and troubleshoot functions that were not working properly. However, implementing semantic element for webpage layout was really helpful, because it kept the codes clean and organized. Check out my end process of how I refracted existing codes for Horiseon website down below:

## Development
Here is a snip it of the development process from changing all the 'div' into semantic element. Div in the lines instead of semantic element. One difficult thing for me was figuring out why some semantic elements were not working and changing the html and css codes to make them work. One example would be not knowing that for 'aside', I could not use a class with it. The formating of the page would not work for a class with aside and it took hours to figure that out after some source digging.

## Conclusion

One of my favorite thing while working on this project was making a table of content for the CSS Style Sheet and refractoring the CSS codes. It was frustrating when certain elements were not working and functioning, but it was rewarding to see the end result.
